= Does Breeze support Varnish and to what extent? =

= Does Breeze support WordPress Multisite?

Breeze is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite without the need for any extra configuration. 

= Is Breeze compatible with other WordPress cache plugins? =

It is not recommended to use two WordPress cache plugins at the same time on any WordPress website. We recommend  that you only stick to Breeze. If there are any other cache plugins installed, please ensure that you have t disabled them prior to proceeding with the Breeze installation.


= Is Breeze compatible with HTTPS? =

Breeze does not require any special configuration to work with HTTP or HTTPS pages.

= Does Breeze have compatibility issues with other known plugins? =

Breeze has been tested with popular plugins available on WordPress.org. Please feel free to report any incompatibilities on the WordPress support forums.

= Does Breeze support CDN? =

Breeze supports CDN integration. It allows all static assets to be served via CDN such as images, css and js files.

= What does Breeze's Database Optimization feature do? =

WordPress databases are notorious for storing information like post revisions, spam comments and much more. Over time, databases will become bloated and it is a good practice to clear out unwanted information from the WordPress database to reduce its size and optimize it.

Breeze's database optimization will help you clear out databases from unwanted information with just a single click.

= Will comments and other dynamic parts of my Blog appear immediately? =

Comments will appear upon moderation as per the comment system (or policy) set in place by the Blog owner. Other dynamic changes such as any modifications in files will require a full cache purge.

= Can I exclude URLs of individual files and pages from cache? =

You can exclude a file by mentioning its URL or file type by mentioning file extension on the exclude fields. Exclude will not let the cache impact that URL or file type. However, you may need to exclude  for Varnish to work. 

= Does it work with all hosting providers? =

Breeze supports all options including Gzip, browser cache, minification, grouping, database optimization. CDN integration will work similarly on all hosting providers. Varnish, however, is compatible with Cloudways servers.
